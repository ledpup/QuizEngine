				"Explanation": "Although capitalism may appear as a social relationship involving inanimate objects, Marx considers that to be part of the <a href\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_fetishism\">fetishism of commodities</a>. \"[...] the commodity-form, and the value-relation of the products of labour within which it appears, have absolutely no connection with the physical nature of the commodity and the material relations arising out of this. It is nothing but the definite social relation between men themselves which assumes here, for them, the fantastic form of a relation between things.\""
